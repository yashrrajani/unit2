Unit 2 Project - Dynamic Search Page

The purpose of this project is to create a dynamic search page that takes a big list of student names and compresses the list to ten students per page with the ability for the user to navigate through different pages. Additionally, a search bar function allows the user to filter through the list of students based on certain keywords.
